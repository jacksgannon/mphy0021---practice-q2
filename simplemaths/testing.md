To run the tests, the user must use the command line interface and go to the 'simplemaths' directory.
By running the command 'pytest' at this directory, all test methods in the test_simplemaths file
will be run (i.e. methods with the prefix 'test_*'.) 
The command line interface will show how many test have passed, failed and the specific issue 
with failed tests.
